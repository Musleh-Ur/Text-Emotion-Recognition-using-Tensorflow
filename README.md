# Text-Emotion-Recognition-using-Tensorflow
Project-based Course Overview
Welcome to Tweet Emotion Recognition with TensorFlow This is a project-based course which should take less than 2 hours to finish. Before diving into the project, please take a look at the 
course objectives and structure.

##Course Objectives
In this course, we will focus on the following objectives:

Using a Tokenizer in TensorFlow

Padding and Truncating Sequences

Creating and Training Recurrent Neural Networks

Using NLP and Deep Learning to perform Text Classification



##Project Structure
Now we will learn to use TensorFlow to create and train a Recurrent Neural Network which will be able to classify emotions in Tweets. We will accomplish it in by completing each task in the project. The hands on project on Tweet Emotion Recognition with TensorFlow is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Introduction

Task 2: Setup and Imports

Task 3: Importing Data

Task 4: Tokenizer

Task 5: Padding and Truncating Sequences

Task 6: Preparing Labels

Task 7: Creating the Model

Task 8: Training the Model

Task 9: Evaluating the Model
